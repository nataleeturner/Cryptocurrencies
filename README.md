# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis is to find a way to group the various cryptocurrencies so that similar options are in each group. During the analysis, I determined that there are 4 clusters of similar cryptocurrencies. Additionally, I included a table with all of the possible cryptocurrencies, as well as a scatter plot that shows each cryptocurrency's Total Coin Supply vs Total Coins Mined. These visuals should allow Accountability Accounting to offer their customers a wealth of information about their cryptocurrency investment options.
